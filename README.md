Full House
=========

## Working on this project

To work on this project, create your own fork (top right) and then clone that to your local machine.

DO NOT clone this repository directly -- we want to use the fork-pull model for code reviews, so you will need to push directly to your own fork, then submit a pull request to the Full-House-UW copy of the repository.

We could use topic branches primarily instead of forks, but that's a discussion that we should have as a group.
